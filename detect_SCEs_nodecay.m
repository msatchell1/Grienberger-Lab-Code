function [S_all] = detect_SCEs_nodecay(S_all)
% Performs the sametask as detect_SCEs.m, but uses S_all.datasetSm_nodecay
% for labelling neuronal Ca activity. 
%
% Detects synchronous calcium events (SCEs). The method of detection is to
% monitor the number of cells with dF/F above
% a threshold act_thres determined by the standard deviation of that cell's noise. If
% at any time the number of active neurons (NAN) reaches the value SCE_thres, an SCE
% is said to be occuring until the number of cells drops back down. To
% prevent brief changes from splitting up a SCE, if an SCE is dropped out
% of and then re-entered within a time(frames) window of
% min_SCE_gap, the SCEs will be joined by including the brief non-SCE
% period into the SCE.
%
% This function adds which neurons have dF/F above threshold per frame
% (act_nrns_perframe_nd), the number of these neurons per frame
% (NAN_perframe_nd), and whether an SCE is occuring per frame
% (isSCE_nd) to S_all.

%% Detecting SCEs
% Now a threshold is defined for the number of neurons required to be
% active simultaneously in order to initiate an SCE. 

% To define the threshold, the NAN trace is shuffled 20 times and the 95th
% percentile of the shuffle is taken as the threshold value. This follows
% the methods of Liu, Xin et al. (2022). â€œE-Cannula reveals anatomical 
% diversity in sharp-wave ripples and a driver for the recruitment of
% distinct hippocampal assemblies".

% Unfortunately there is a problem with this method, as it defines
% thresholds that are too low.



% Another way to define SCE_thres is to use histograms, similar to what is
% done to find the noise std dF/F for each neuron. Here, only NAN during non-running
% is considered - the noise in NAN is found during standing times by
% binning all standing time NAN data into a histogram. Then the SCE_thres
% can be defined at 2 or 3 stds above the noise. Note this threshold will
% only work when applied to standing periods, so I can't use this threshold
% everywhere. Also I will need to create the threshold using data that has
% enough standing in it. 

vel = S_all.wsALL(:,2).*80; % Mouse velocity in cm/s.

stand_thres = 1; % Everything below this value qualifies as standing (cm/s).
stand_log = vel < stand_thres; % Logical array of frames where v < stand_thres cm/s.
stand_inds = find(stand_log); % Indices where v < stand_thres.

% The percentage of frames spent standing
prct_stand = 100*(length(stand_inds)/length(vel))

% Each imaging frame is mapped onto a wavesurfer frame with
% S_all.frametimingOriginal. Below takes the knowledge of which ws frames
% occur when vel < stand_thres, and uses frametimingOriginal to convert
% that to which imaging frames occur when vel < stand_thres.

 % Imaging frames that occur during standing in [ws frame timing, imaging
 % frame timing].
[stand_im_frames_ws, stand_im_frames_im, ~] = intersect(S_all.frametimingOriginal, stand_inds, 'stable');

stand_NAN = NAN_perframe_nd(stand_im_frames_im); % Selects the NAN values that 
% occur during standing imaging frames.

ws_time_sec = (1:size(S_all.wsALL,1))./S_all.acq; % Gets ws frame times in seconds.

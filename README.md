# Grienberger-Lab-Code
Code created by Michael Satchell during my rotation in the lab of Dr. Christine Grienberger.

master_script runs all the data processing. Edit data_dir to the location of your .tif files, with wavesurfer files in a subfolder named "wavesurfer" 
and Suite2P files in a subfolder named "suite2p." Then run master_script. 

explore_plots is a script containing sections for producing different plots. Run the whole script once before trying to run individual sections.
